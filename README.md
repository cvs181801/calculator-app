MDAS Calculator

Simple yet effective calculator which supports Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction in the proper order!

This calculator, complete with bright colors, was built using vanilla Javascript.  It's designed according the the mathematical principle of PEMDAS, with one caveat - since it doesn't support calculation / input of parentheses or exponents, it's technically more of an 'MDAS' calculator.  

The MDAS order of operations is achieved by using multiple loops to calculate results according to the order Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.  I used regular expressions to capture the operands the user enters, as well as the numbers, which go into an array and get passed through the MDAS function loops. If the result is a decimal, it should round to the nearest 10 thousandth place (2 decimal points).  Total time to completion: 3 days (plus a little extra time to make it look nice).

Wishlist: 
- Negative numbers.  Currently, the calculator is not programmed to support negative numbers.  It would be nice to add this feature into the programming.
